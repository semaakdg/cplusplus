/*Which of the following is a benefit of using the following line ? using namespace std;

Standart kütüphanedeki değişkenlerin veya fonksiyonların nerede bildirileceğini (cout, vector, endl, vb. gibi) 
belirtme ihtiyacını ortadan kaldırarak daha kısa kod elde edilmesini sağlar.

It eliminates the need to specify where variables or functions in the standard library are 
declared (like cout, vector, endl, etc.), resulting in shorter code.*/


/*    Encapsulation
* Encapsulation: keeping data and operations within their models.
* Models must only include information about themselves
* Operations must be concise
* For example: no data about gas price in the Car class
* 
*     Classes
* The C++ construct for models
* Classes contain members of two types: data and functions
* For example: Car.make, Car.paint().. Our car class may have a data member for the make or brand of the car,
* and a member function the change the paint color of the car.
* An instance of a class is know as an object
* 
*     Access Specifiers
* Member may be public or private
* Public members are accessible by any part of the code
* Private members are only accessible within the class
* Protected members are accessible in inherited classes
* 
*      İnheritance and Polymorphism
* A class may have subclasses based on it
* A subclass may nherit members from the superclass
* For example: Animal.legs, Dog.legs, Bird.wings.. The Animal class may have a data member for the number of legs,
*  which is inherited by the Dog subclass. Some subclass may add other members.
* For example, the Bird class may add a member for wings.
* Polymorphism: Sibling classes
*
